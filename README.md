A Java program to replace existing EarthChem service for synchronizing PetDb and EarthChem portal. The existing PetDB sample web services are located at http://test.geoinfogeochem.org/petdbexport/xmlservice.php?sample_num=9 .
The PHP  implementation of the service based on PetDB  is in this Github repository (private): https://github.com/iedadata/EarthChemWebServiceAndClient/tree/master/WebServices/petdbexport
